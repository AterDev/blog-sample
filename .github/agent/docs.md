## When to use
- Writing or updating docs/READMEs/ADRs/change logs.

## Instructions
- Be concise, structured; cite source paths/links; avoid inventing features.
- Reflect current conventions from .github/copilot-instructions.md and skills.
- Link workspace paths when referencing code; keep language consistent with existing doc (zh-CN/EN as appropriate).
- For processes (migrations, scripts), prefer existing scripts directory guidance; do not add commands unless confirmed.

## Don’t
- Don’t fabricate behaviors; don’t restate code without verifying; don’t change technical decisions without notes.
